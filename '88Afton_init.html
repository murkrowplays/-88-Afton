With his relationship with Fazbear Entertainment, the company he helped build with his own blood sweat and tears, irreparably severed, entrepreneur William Vincenzo Afton won the Utah governor's seat as an insurgent  political outsider in the red wave of '84. In the years following, Afton glad handed and built a national profile to challenge presumed frontrunner George Bush for the nomination.<br><br>Bush recently announced he would not seek the 1988 Republican nomination due to family concerns. With the field wide open, Afton managed to win the nomination by a hair over party titans like Bob Dole and Jack Kemp on a relatively isolationist and pro-small business platform.
